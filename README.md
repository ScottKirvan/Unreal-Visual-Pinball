- **dev** - development branch - more likely to be unstable, buggy, or fuggly.

## Current Status
Refactoring and reorganizing. Creating proper modules and getting things scoped properly.

## Project Origins
Huge thanks go to Datasung from [bits4u.nl](https://www.bits4u.nl/unreal-engine-visual-pinball-part-1/).  He started the project 
as an Unreal C++ code project and allowed me to jump in, convert it to an Unreal Plugin, and start implementing some more features and
ideas.  We're both big fans pinball -- the art, the technology, the comradery -- and of all the work that's been done in the
visual/virtual pinball space.
