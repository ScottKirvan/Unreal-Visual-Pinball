# Unreal-Visual-Pinball

## Branches
- **main** - main dev branch - should be good to pull and work with but may have issues.
- **dev** - development branch - more likely to be unstable, buggy, or fuggly.

## Current Status
Greetings and welcome!  First, a quick word of warning:  This is an in-development project - 
it is not ready for play-testing and no playable games have been built with it yet.

Refactoring and reorganizing. Creating proper modules and getting things scoped properly.

Wanna play along?  Help is welcome - you can contact me on my 
[discord](https://discord.gg/TSKHvVFYxB) server.  I'm cptvideo up there.

## Project Origins
Huge thanks go to [Datasung](https://github.com/datasung) from [bits4u.nl](https://www.bits4u.nl/unreal-engine-visual-pinball-part-1/).  He started the project 
as an Unreal C++ code project and allowed me to jump in, convert it to an Unreal Plugin, and start implementing some more features and
ideas.  We're both big fans pinball -- the art, the technology, the comradery -- and of all the work that's been done in the
visual/virtual pinball space.
