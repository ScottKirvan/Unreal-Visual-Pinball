# Unreal Pinmame Connection.
# Connect Unreal Engine to Pinmame pinball emulator
I allways have been a fan of pinball machines and I admire the work that has been put into te Pinmame pinball emulator.
Also a great fan of the Unreal game engine I wanted to connect the Unreal engine to the Pinmame emulator.
Pinmame is build as a COM control wich makes interfacing not straightforward because you have to deal with things like “Marschalling”.
After some trail and error I managed to contruct some C++ Blueprint Function classes for Unreal that work very wel during first testing.
So I decided to post a first preview of my project.

More info can be found at bits4u.nl.
You can download a copy of a Unreal example project at https://www.bits4u.nl/ASSETS/VPinball.rar
You can contact me at info@bits4u.nl.

Not all the interfaces of Pinmame are present in this release but you can easily extend it yourself by using this code as a template or wait
until i finisched implementing the rest.
